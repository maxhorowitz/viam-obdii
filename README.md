# Viam Starter Kit - My First Component
This repository contains a simple example of how to build a custom Viam sensor component. With this approach any type of hardware device can be wrapped and integrated into the Viam ecosystem. This first example uses Python and is closely inline with our documentation, providing you all the required details to further expand and explore components beyond a simple sensor.

[Learn how to build Viam components here](https://docs.viam.com/registry/create/)

For more advanced people or after having this successfuly completed, have a look at this more detailed [repository](https://github.com/viam-labs/python-example-module) which also explains how to use the Viam Modular Registry
